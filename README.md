  The rise in technological advancements and Social Networking Sites (SNS) made people more engaged 
  in their virtual lives.Research has revealed that people feel more comfortable posting their feelings, 
  including suicidal thoughts, on SNS than discussing them through face-to-face settings due to the social 
  stigma associated with mental health .Many suicidal deaths can be prevented by understanding how people 
  communicate their distress related thoughts. Early understanding of the risk factors and warning signs 
  can decrease the threshold for suicide and help prevent many deaths. This Project aims to develop a 
  system that can detect suicidal ideation on Twitter tweets using DL models. In this project we trained 
  several Deep learning models such as LSTM(Long Short -Term Memory), GRU(Gated Recurrent unit),andCNN(ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork)

      Streamlit is an open-source Python library designed to help developers and data 
      scientists create interactive web applications quickly and easily. With its simplicity 
      and Pythonic approach, Streamlit has gained popularity for a wide range of 
      applications in data science, machine learning, and data visualization projects.And we
      Deployed our Trained Models using streamlit.

     In the Existing system various machine learning algorithms and ensemble approaches like Decision trees, 
     Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support vector machine (SMO), Regression, Bagging, Random 
     Forest, AdaBoost, voting and Stacking are implemented for classifying the suicide-related tweets into two 
     groups using the real tweets.
     After studying the literature, it was found that dataset used in the research was very low as data is not freely 
     available due to its ethical considerations and the studies which were already done in this area of research 
     have not achieved much accuracy and recall

     This project aims to develop a system that can detect suicidal ideation on Twitter using Natural Language 
     Processing (NLP) and Deep learning models include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
     Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).We have used the Twitter Suicide Dataset, which 
     contains Tweets from individuals who have experienced suicidal thoughts and ideations. The dataset includes 
     more than 1787 Tweets and comments, and it has been labeled as either indicating suicidal ideation or not.
