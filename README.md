                                The rise in technological advancements and Social Networking Sites (SNS) made people more engaged 
                                in their virtual lives.Research has revealed that people feel more comfortable posting their feelings, 
                                including suicidal thoughts, on SNS than discussing them through face-to-face settings due to the social 
                                stigma associated with mental health .Many suicidal deaths can be prevented by understanding how people 
                                communicate their distress related thoughts. Early understanding of the risk factors and warning signs 
                                can decrease the threshold for suicide and help prevent many deaths. This Project aims to develop a 
                                system that can detect suicidal ideation on Twitter tweets using DL models. In this project we trained 
                                several Deep learning models such as LSTM(Long Short -Term Memory), GRU(Gated Recurrent 
                                unit),andCNN(ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork)
